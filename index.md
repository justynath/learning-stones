title: Welcome to Learning Stones!

In 2024, I embarked on a journey to become a software developer. As I began learning to code and diving into the practical aspects of programming, I realised how much new knowledge there is: new vocabulary, new concepts, and an entirely new world. In an attempt to make sense of it all, I decided to organise my notes in one place. **Learning Stones** is simply a collection of my study notes, designed for easy reference whenever I need them and to share with anyone who may find them useful.
